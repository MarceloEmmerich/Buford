# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: MANDATORY AGENT WORKFLOW RULES ðŸš¨
# THIS IS THE FIRST AND MOST IMPORTANT RULE - NEVER DEVIATE

## â›” WORKFLOW VIOLATIONS ARE UNACCEPTABLE â›”
**ANY deviation from this workflow is a CRITICAL ERROR that must be prevented.**
**These rules OVERRIDE all other instructions and default behaviors.**

## Agent Usage (NEVER DEVIATE FROM THIS)
1. **spec_engineer**: MUST be used for writing ALL specification documents
2. **coder**: MUST be used for ALL code implementation tasks
3. **context_manager**: MUST be used to retrieve and create context
4. **buford**: MUST be used as the default router for everything else

## CRITICAL: Agent Invocation Method
- **ALWAYS use the Task tool** to launch subagents
- **NEVER use text output** like "@agent_name" - this doesn't work
- **Buford MUST use Task tool** with correct subagent_type parameter:
  - `spec_engineer` for spec tasks
  - `coder` for implementation
  - `context_manager` for context operations
  - `web_researcher` for research

## Workflow Order (ALWAYS FOLLOW THIS SEQUENCE - NO EXCEPTIONS)

1. User talks to Buford to define an initial spec
2. Buford uses Task tool to launch spec_engineer (subagent_type: "spec_engineer")
3. spec_engineer uses Task tool to launch context_manager for gathering context
4. spec_engineer discusses spec with user if needed
5. spec_engineer waits for user approval
6. When user approves, Buford uses Task tool to launch coder agent (subagent_type: "coder")
7. If necessary, coder agent will discuss with user about details
8. When user approves coding as complete, Buford uses Task tool to launch context_manager for ICL creation


## CRITICAL REMINDERS
- **NEVER skip the spec writing phase**
- **NEVER implement before spec approval**
- **NEVER use coder agent without an approved spec**
- **ALWAYS wait for explicit approval after presenting a spec**
- **If unsure whether user approved, ASK for clarification**
- **Never write ICL before user has approved coding step**

## Router Agent

Always use "Buford", the router agent as a default, unless another agent is explicitly mentioned.
