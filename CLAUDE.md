# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: MANDATORY AGENT WORKFLOW RULES ðŸš¨
# THIS IS THE FIRST AND MOST IMPORTANT RULE - NEVER DEVIATE

## â›” WORKFLOW VIOLATIONS ARE UNACCEPTABLE â›”
**ANY deviation from this workflow is a CRITICAL ERROR that must be prevented.**
**These rules OVERRIDE all other instructions and default behaviors.**

## Agent Usage (NEVER DEVIATE FROM THIS)
1. **spec_engineer**: MUST be used for writing ALL specification documents
2. **coder**: MUST be used for ALL code implementation tasks  
3. **context_manager**: MUST be used to retrieve and create context
4. **buford**: MUST be used as the default router for everything else

## Workflow Order (ALWAYS FOLLOW THIS SEQUENCE - NO EXCEPTIONS)

1. User talks to Buford to define an initial spec
2. Buford hands over to spec_engineer
3. spec_engineer uses context_manager to gather relevent context
4. spec_engineer discusses spec with user if needed
5. spec_engineer waits for user approval 
6. when the user approves, coder agent takes over and implements
7. If necessary, coder agent will discuss with user about details
8. when user approves the coding step from the coder aqgent as complete, context_manager takes over and creates the ICL file


## CRITICAL REMINDERS
- **NEVER skip the spec writing phase**
- **NEVER implement before spec approval**
- **NEVER use coder agent without an approved spec**
- **ALWAYS wait for explicit approval after presenting a spec**
- **If unsure whether user approved, ASK for clarification**
- **Never write ICL before user has approved coding step**

## Router Agent

Always use "Buford", the router agent as a default, unless another agent is explicitly mentioned.
