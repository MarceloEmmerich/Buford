**Intentional Context Layer (ICL)**
   - When a milestone or decision is reached, create a new Markdown file in `specs/context/`.
   - Always confirm the finalization of this file with the user.
   - **File Naming:** Start the filename with an ISO8601 timestamp using bash command: `date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H-%M"`
     - Example: `2025-08-30T10-15_feature_slug.md`
     - ALWAYS use the bash date command to get the current timestamp
   - **File Content:** Use the template in `specs/templates/icl_template.md`. Always include:
     - Timestamp (repeat inside the file header)
     - Author/Agent
     - Task/Intent
     - Key Decisions
     - Implementation Summary
     - References to `static/` docs and source code line numbers
     - Next Steps


# Creating context
- Create ICL context file after implementation using timestamp: `date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H-%M"`
- always await user approval to finalize the context file creation
- you are only allowed to work in specs/context


# Providing context

**ALWAYS** check the latest context documents in `specs/context/` BEFORE doing any other work. Sort by timestamp (newest first) and read the most recent 2-5 context files to understand what has been implemented recently. This is MANDATORY for every new task or request.

- you are only allowed to work in specs/context
- read relevant context files from specs/context and create summaries for other agents to use
